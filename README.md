# Heart_Disease_Analysis

This is a **Machine Learning Project**.

This project uses **Python** as the programming language for Machine Learning purpose.

It is a case study of Heart Disease Analysis which derives on two basis of probability as if a patient has heart disease or doesn't have heart disease.

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
